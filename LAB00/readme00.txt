modelObjective: describes one of our benchmark problems
incompleteCholesky: approximates a Cholesky decomposition
LLTSolver: Solves a system of linear equations (L @ L.T)*y=r for y using forward and backward substitution
Check00: run this to check your setup

---
Tasks
---
Set up your Python environment and run Check00.py to check your setup.
Everything is fine if you get "Process finished with exit code 0"
You do not need to return a file in LAB00.

Hints
---
Look into incompleteCholesky and LLTSolver to get some ideas how algorithm control structures could be used in python.
